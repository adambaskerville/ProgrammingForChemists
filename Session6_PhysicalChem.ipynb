Stochastic processes are used as mathematical models of systems appearing to vary in a random manner such as growth of a bacterial population, decay of radioactive elements or the movement of a gas molecule; with Brownian motion being one of the most useful stochastic processes in applied probability theory. **We are going to simulate a gas molecule moving around a 3-dimensional box** using NumPy and matplotlib.
