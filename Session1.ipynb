    "In the above examples you may have noticed multiple `#` symbols with text written after them. These are known as **comments** and are a crucial and often underused aspect of programming languages. Comments are lines that exist in computer programs that are ignored by the program. Including comments in programs makes code more readable for humans as it provides some information or explanation about what each part of a program is doing. In general, it is a good idea to write comments while you are writing or updating a program as it is easy to forget your thought process later on, and comments written later may be less useful in the long term. Comments are also very appreciated by someone who may use your program or be tasked with modifying parts of it, as they need an insight into your thought process. Try to avoid W.E.T comments meaning you 'Wrote Everything Twice'. Comments such as:"
