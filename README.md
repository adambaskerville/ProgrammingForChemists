# Programming for Chemists

This course is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming languages and how it is applied in solving real world scientific problems. If you have wanted to learn how to program or how to apply it to your own work then hopefully this course can be of assistance. The sessions are as follows:

1. Introduction and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Key data types and uses.
3. Control Flow Statements.
4. Basic NumPy and arrays. 
5. File input/output using pandas and plotting using matplotlib.
6. Physical chemistry using NumPy, SciPy and Sympy.
7. How machine learning is changing science

If you have any feedback from taking the course then feel free to contact me so I can continually improve it.
