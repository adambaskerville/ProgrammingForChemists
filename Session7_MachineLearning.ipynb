    "**Turing test:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning, the buzzword of the last 10 years with the distinction between applied statistics and machine learning often blurry; but what is machine learning? why is it important? why is there a session dedicated to it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has been one of the **most influential** advancements in modern computing with its current implementation a realisation of the pioneering work of Alan Turing in the 1950s;  where he published multiple papers, one titled \"[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238)\". In this paper he described \"*The Imitation Game*\" as a means of answering a big question, \"*Can machines think?*\". Being very practically minded Turing noted that trying to define **thinking** is a philosophical hurdle so opted for rephrasing the question as \"*Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?*\" drawing a sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a human. \n",
    "\n",
    "Turing described his version of the \"*imitation game*\", in which an interrogator attempts to distinguish which of two players is female, and where each player, hidden from sight, attempts to fool the interrogator into thinking they are the female through written answers to the interrogator’s questions. In Turing’s version, the male is replaced by a machine that attempts to respond to questions in such a way as to fool the interrogator into thinking it, not the female player, is female. \n",
    "\n",
    "The imitation game is now more commonly referred to as the **Turing test** and a subtle but vital quality of the test is that *written human language represents human-level thinking*. If the human Turing test judge is competent, then an entity requires *human-level intelligence* in order to pass the test. Modern AI systems must pass this test if they are to be deemed to have human level intelligence and as of November 2020, **nothing has passed the Turing test**, even if some have claimed to. It is predicted that something will pass the Turing test between the years 2029 and 2040.\n",

    "**Aim of this session:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a **vast** and **rapidly** growing field of research built on very complex mathematics and statistics; which we will **not** cover. Instead we are going to explore how you can **use** it to solve real world problems; application over theory. There is a high probability you will end up using some form of machine learning in your future careet, so it is more important you understand how you can use it as opposed to spending months understanding the mathematics behind the algorithms. We already benefit from machine learning in our day to day lives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image recognition**: Software trained using ML to scan through hundreds of MRI and CT medical images per second highlighting abnormalities.\n",
    "* **Medical diagnosis**: Training programs using clinical symptoms to accurately diagnose patients. \n",
    "* **Speech recognition**: ML is behind the rise of assistant software like Alexa and Siri. \n",
    "* **Google**: Google is at the forefront, investing huge amounts of money into all facets of ML. It is used in their translation software, Google photos, Google assistant, Google Maps and many more.\n",
    "* **Financial services**: Used extensively in the finance sector to predict market shifts, customer spending patterns and it can even predict account closures before they occur!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Philosophy of AI:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a hotly debated issue in computer science and wider society for good reason; it could be humanities greatest invention but could it be our last? My personal take is more optimistic believing that AI systems capable of learning will only enhance and improve our own capability of learning. If I am wrong, at least this session will give an insight into how the machine overlords will *think*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin we need to learn some basic terminology and what tools we need to start using machine learning."
