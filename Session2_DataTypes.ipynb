OOP focuses on the **objects that developers want to manipulate** rather than the logic required to manipulate them. \n",

    "`Floating point numbers` are numbers that **do** have a fractional part, e.g. 7.3715 or 3.14159. The \"float\" refers to the fact that a number's decimal point can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number. In general floating point numbers are represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base, for example the floating point number 4.1384\n",

    "\n",
    "This position is indicated as the exponent component, and thus the floating-point representation is very similar to scientific notation. Understanding floating point numbers and their limitations are vital as they are one of the most used data types in all of science. Say an astrophysicist wants to use the speed of light, $c \\approx 299 792 458 \\text{ms}^{-1}$, and Newton's gravitational constant, $G = 0.0000000000667$ in the same calculation, how do we handle the difference in magnitudes between these numbers? With floating point numbers! \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, floating point numbers are implemented using the `double` type from the `C` programming language meaning they are accurate to approximately 15-16 decimal places. Precision of floating point numbers varies between computers but for nearly all applications this does not pose an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers have the advantage of being able to represent very large and very small numbers, but unfortunately when converting a decimal number into a binary representation, base 2, floating point numbers cannot be represented exactly. Due to limited computer memory you have to 'cut off' the decimal part at some point and continue on with the calculation, hence the creation of the `double` data type which is accurate to approximately 15-16 decimal places. Any digits past this point should be considered **incorrect**. Unfortunately these error digits can cause headaches for programmers as they can accumulate throughout a calculation and cause rounding errors.\n",

The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) relies crucially on the ability to track charged particles with exquisite precision (10 microns over a 10m length) and high reliability (over 99% of roughly 1000 charged particles per collision correctly identified)$^{[1]}$. It is critical that any rounding errors are not ignored as it could result in a missed collision or a mis-identified one.\n",

    "* **1991 patriot missile defence disaster$^{[2]}$:** The American patriot missile defense battery failed to intercept an incoming Scud missile which killed 28 soldiers. The internal clock of the defense system measured and stored time as an integer value in units of tenths of a second; and so this number was multiplied by 1/10 to produce the time in seconds. 1/10, has a non-terminating binary representation and was chopped at approximately 7 digits after the decimal point. The Patriot battery had been active for around 100 hours, and these truncations of the time measurements resulted in an effective time error of ~ 0.34 seconds. A Scud missile travels at 1,676 metres per second, travelling more than half a kilometre in this time. This resulted in the system mis-tracking the incoming Scud projectile, instead scanning an area of airspace more than 500 metres from the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1996 Ariane 5 rocket explosion$^{[3]}$:** Shortly after the launch of the rocket, the inertial guidance system produced a number which was interpreted by the rockets' on-board computer as a course change. The on-board computer then reacted correctly to get back on the right course based on that number. However, even though the number from the guidance system looked like a course change, it was not. The guidance system had actually shut down because of a number conversion error which was not handled correctly. The shut down was caused when the software attempted to convert a 64 bit velocity number capable of representing billions of numbers into a 16 bit number which is only capable of representing 65,535 values. For the first few seconds of flight, the rocket’s acceleration was low meaning the conversion between these two values was successful. As the rocket’s velocity increased, the 64-bit variable became too large and could no longer fit in a 16-bit variable. This resulted in a `integer overflow` error which was not handled correctly; resulting in the **\\$500 million** unmanned rocket exploding seconds after launch, a catastrophe that could have been prevented by just a few lines of code. Below is a clip of the sudden, incorrect course change the Ariane 5 rocket made:\n",
